*Homework 5

**Make
A) target=app.o, dependency=app.c, command=gcc. The -c option means compile but do not link

**Installing the Kernel Source
I installed version 5.3.2 and can boot to either version (the kernel modules part of this homework was done in v4.14)

**Cross-Compiling
Screenshots of both the host output and the bone output are in the hw05 git directory

**Kernel Modules
I wasn't sure what files to include for this part, so I included the .ko files (and the .c file for part 3, since that had more changes)
